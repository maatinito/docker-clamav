# Introduction

Dockerfile to build an [Clam Antivirus](https://www.clamav.net) container image to scan files or most commonly, mail messages.

* This Container uses a [customized Alpine base](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian) which includes [s6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) enabled for PID 1 Init capabilities, [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org) for individual container monitoring, Cron also installed along with other tools (bash,curl, less, logrotate, nano, vim) for easier management. 

This version differs from tiredofit in the configuration where DetectPUA (Potential Unwanted Applications) is desactivated to allows some Excel files with protected cells.

# Prerequisites

This container doesn't do much on it's own unless you use an additional service or communicator to talk to it!


# Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Registry](https://hub.docker.com/tiredofit/clamav) and is the recommended method of installation.


```bash
docker pull hub.docker.com/tiredofit/clamav:(imagetag)
```

* `latest` - Most recent release of ClamAV w/Alpine Linux 3.6

# Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.


# Configuration
